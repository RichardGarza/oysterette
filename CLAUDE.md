- ✅ Configured EAS Update for OTA updates
- ✅ Created deployment automation scripts
- ✅ Successfully built Android APK
- ✅ APK Link: https://expo.dev/accounts/rgactr/projects/oysterette/builds/45f05f60-fe6d-4fe3-bfbb-9da657b2c7e1

**Deployment Workflow:**

```bash
# Quick updates (no new APK needed):
npm run deploy-update "Fix bug in search"

# Local APK build (1-3 minutes):
npm run build:android:local

# Cloud APK build (5-10 minutes):
npm run build:android:cloud
```

**Auto-Update System:**

### Phase 5.1: User Rating & Voting System ✅ DEPLOYED!

**Status:** Complete - Live in Production

**What We Built:**

- ✅ Database schema with aggregated rating fields
- ✅ Sophisticated rating calculation service (40% rating + 60% attributes)
- ✅ Auto-recalculation on review create/update/delete
- ✅ Mobile UI components (RatingDisplay, RatingBreakdown)
- ✅ Integrated ratings into oyster list cards
- ✅ Voting system (agree/disagree on reviews)
- ✅ User credibility tracking based on vote patterns
- ✅ Credibility badges: Novice (0-0.9), Trusted (1.0-1.4), Expert (1.5+)

**How It Works:**

1. User submits review → Auto-calculates ratings
2. Dynamic weighting: More reviews = more user influence
3. Algorithm: 70% user ratings + 30% seed data (after 5+ reviews)
4. Overall score (0-10): 40% rating + 60% attributes
5. Other users can vote agree/disagree on reviews
6. Credibility builds over time based on voting patterns

---

### Priority 3: User Profile Enhancements (FUTURE)

import Fuse from 'fuse.js';

const fuse = new Fuse(oysters, {
keys: ['name', 'origin', 'species'],
threshold: 0.3, // 0 = exact, 1 = match anything
includeScore: true,
useExtendedSearch: true,
});

const results = fuse.search(searchQuery);

```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Handles typos and misspellings
- ✅ Can show "Did you mean...?" suggestions
- ✅ Weighted search across multiple fields
- ✅ Still fast with 800+ oysters
- ✅ No database migration needed

- Show "You might like..." section

**B. Collaborative Filtering (Advanced)**
- Find users with similar taste
- Recommend their favorites
- "Users who liked X also liked Y"

**Implementation:**
- Start with simple approach
- Add collaborative filtering later

**Estimated Time:** 6-8 hours (simple), 12-16 hours (advanced)

---

### Priority 4: Oyster Photo Gallery (LOW PRIORITY - FUTURE)

- Replace current list with personalized feed
- "Recommended for You" section at top
- "Top Rated" section below
- "Recently Added" section
- Easy navigation to full oyster list

**Implementation:**

- New backend endpoint: `/api/users/:userId/recommendations`
- Calculate similarity scores for all oysters
- Return top 10 matches
- Cache results for performance

**Algorithm Pseudocode:**

```typescript
function getRecommendations(userId: string) {
  // Get user's reviews
  const userReviews = await getReviews(userId);

  // Calculate average preferences
  const avgPreferences = calculateAverageAttributes(userReviews);

  // Find oysters user hasn't reviewed
  const unreviewed = await getUnreviewedOysters(userId);

  // Calculate similarity scores
  const scored = unreviewed.map((oyster) => ({
    oyster,
    similarity: calculateSimilarity(avgPreferences, oyster.attributes),
  }));

  // Sort by similarity
  return scored.sort((a, b) => b.similarity - a.similarity).slice(0, 10);
}
```

### Priority 9: Homepage Redesign

**Status:** Backlog
**Estimated Time:** 8-12 hours

**Current Issues:**

- Home screen is just a welcome message
- Users must navigate to "Browse" to see oysters
- Wasted screen space

**New Design:**

**Option A: Direct to Oyster List (Simplest)**

- Remove home screen entirely
- Default screen is Browse with search
- Bottom tabs: Browse, Profile, Settings

**Option B: Enhanced Home with Quick Actions (Recommended)**

- **Hero Section:**

  - Welcome message
  - Search bar (immediate oyster search)
  - Quick stats: "838 Oysters • 1,234 Reviews"

- **Recommended for You** (if logged in)

  - Horizontal scroll of 5-10 personalized oysters
  - "See All" button

- **Top Rated This Week**

  - Horizontal scroll of highest-rated oysters
  - Drives engagement

- **Recently Added**

  - Newest oysters in database
  - Keeps content fresh

- **Quick Actions**
  - "Browse All Oysters" button
  - "Add Your Review" button
  - "Submit New Oyster" button

**Implementation:**

- Update `HomeScreen.tsx` with new layout
- Add horizontal ScrollView components
- Use existing API endpoints
- Add skeleton loaders for smooth UX

## Universal Token-Saving Rules

| Rule                             | Saves            | How to Apply                                           |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Only send changed files**      | 50–150 k → 1–5 k | `git diff --name-only HEAD~1` → paste only those paths |
| **Never paste full files**       | 30 k+ per file   | Use `head -30` / `tail -30` or `...[truncated]`        |
| **Paginate DB queries**          | 10 k rows → 3 k  | `LIMIT 100 OFFSET ?` in seed scripts                   |
| **Truncate logs**                | 15 k log → 1 k   | `head -50`, `tail -50`, or `…[truncated]`              |
| **Clear context between tasks**  | 80 k history → 0 | Type `/clear` or start new chat after each feature     |
| **Ask for diffs, not full code** | 20 k → 2 k       | “Show fix as Git diff”                                 |
